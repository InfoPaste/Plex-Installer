# Plex Media Server Installer for Ubuntu 16.04
This bash script (for the most part) installs a media server on your Ubuntu OS and was writen to simplify this [guide](https://thisisforsomething.com/guide/guide-to-plex-media-server-on-ubuntu-server-16-04/). I recommend you take a look at it before continuing.


By no means is this the most effective or efficient way of installing and setting up a Plex Media Server. If you have suggestions or improves please let me know.


It has been tested on Ubuntu 16.04 and I cannot guarantee it will work with any other OS.

## What does this script install?
> [Plex Media Server](https://www.plex.tv/) – The key component that will be serving all of our media files.


> [Deluge](http://deluge-torrent.org/) – The bittorrent client we will be using in conjunction with CouchPotato and Sonarr.


> [CouchPotato](https://couchpota.to/) – Automation for finding and downloading movies to use with Plex.


> [Sonarr](https://sonarr.tv/) – Automation for finding and downloading tv shows to use with Plex.


> [PlexPy](https://github.com/JonnyWong16/plexpy/asdhttps://github.com/JonnyWong16/plexpy/https://github.com/JonnyWong16/plexpy/) – Allows you to monitor users and viewing habits on your Plex Media Server.


> [Ombi (PlexRequests.NET)](https://github.com/tidusjar/Ombi) – Allows your plex users to request movies and television shows with out bugging you.


> [Jackett](https://github.com/Jackett/Jackett) – Allows you to use private trackers with couchpotato and sonarr.
